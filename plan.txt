1. Pass a problem to an LLM which will extract the key details and put it in some format.
    Running locally cus I am NOT paying shit.
        Use gguf + 0llama for quick setup and fast inference. (speed will be important when I move to cloud hardware).
    Possible choices (given by GPT): LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, OpenHermes 2.5, Nous-Hermes 2 Mistral
    Extract into JSON (?) format
        Each object could be something in the problem (ie. point charge, field origin, charged object)
        Given values provided for each object.
        Describe the goal in a way that my program can understand.

2. Do all the maths and stuff to determine the dynamics of the scene.
    Use numpy (or CuPy for running on GPU) for computations.

3. Pass that info to manim, outputting an mp4 file

4. Display ts to the user (maybe on the web)
