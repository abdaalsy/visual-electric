# Visual Electric
Made to help university and high school students build an intuition for electrodynamic/electrostatics! Enter a problem you're having trouble visualizing and learn from an intuitive animation. This tool will (hopefully) visualize problems involving:

- Coulomb's Law
- Electric fields
- Electric potential

... or a mix of these. 

Note that these visualizations aren't gonna be a mirror of reality, rather an approximation. Accelerations will probably be assumed to be constant, dependent on the values derived at time=0. 

Sitting here typing this at the beginning of this project, I honestly have absolutely no idea how I'm gonna make this work. There's so much open-endedness. It's really daunting, but this project is too cool to not do. Imagine how sick its gonna be once its in a working state.
